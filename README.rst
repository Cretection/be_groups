The original project was developed by AOE GmbH. The following developers were responsible for the development:
 * Michael Klapper <michael.klapper@aoe.com>
 * Tomas Norre Mikkelsen <tomas.mikkelsen@aoe.com>
 * Martin Tepper <martin.tepper@aoe.com>
I saw the extension in use during my internship at AOE GmbH and thought it was a pity that it was not released. While searching for a similar extension I stumbled across the now publicly available source code on https://github.com/AOEpeople/be_groups and tried to reactivate the extension for TYPO3 11.

My special thanks go to ``Michael Klapper``!
